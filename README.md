## Documentation
 
See https://github.com/nyeholt/silverstripe-advancedreports/wiki

The Advanced Report module provides a flexible mechanism for defining reports
that are more complex in structure than the standard SilverStripe reports. 
Advanced Reports are saved as files in the filesystem, allowing snapshots
of information to be saved for later perusal. 

In addition to manually generating reports, they can be scheduled for automatic
generation on a schedule.
